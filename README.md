## Description

A blog-like web application intented to serve as a multidevice platform for science divulgation in Catalan language. Its purpose is to aggregate and display curated high-quality content (written articles and videos) to the general public, both on the general feed and upon access to a number of specialized sections. It features search and filtering functionalities that allow general users browse for the knowledge they are looking for.
